# TLS
These both files (`key.pem` and `cert.pem`) are generated by:
```sh
$ go run /usr/local/go/src/crypto/tls/generate_cert.go --rsa-bits=2048 --host=localhost
```

# Alternative
## The mkcert tool
As an alternative to the `generate_cert.go` tool [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert), it has the advantage that the generated certificates are locally trusted â€” meaning that you can use them for testing and development without getting security warnings in your web browser.

# NOTE
This directory should be added to ignore rule in version control system (like Git or Mercurial).
